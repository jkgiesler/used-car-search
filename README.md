Parsing vast.com used car listings to shop for a car

This project was insipred by http://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-buy-a-used-car-with-r-part-1/. I chose to use vast.com because their data was easier to scrape. Any change to their website will make this code unusable, but I'll try to keep it up to date.
