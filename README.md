# used-car-search

This project was inspired by http://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-buy-a-used-car-with-r-part-1/. I chose to use vast.com because their data was easy to scrape. I could get all the information I needed from the summary page without having to visit each individual listing. 

Inside the Data folder are some very rough graphs made in excel which show how useful these data can be in deciding on a used car to purchase.

Any change to their website will make this code unusable, but I'll try to keep it up to date.
